                  <p>
                    Massey Hall is a performing arts theatre in the Garden District of downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The theatre was designed to seat 3,500 patrons, but after extensive renovations in the 1940s it now seats up to 2,765.
                  </p>
                  <p>Massey Hall and the more intimate Eaton Auditorium were the only substantial concert venues in Toronto before the 1982 opening of Roy Thomson Hall.    
                  </p>
                  <p>Massey Hall was designated a National Historic Site of Canada on June 15, 1981.The Hall closed in July 2018 for a two-year-long renovation including a new seven-storey addition and two smaller concert rooms.
                  </p>
                  <p>The idea of Massey Music Hall began with Hart Massey, who wanted to build a music hall in order to fill the need for a secular meeting place where people from Toronto and area could meet and enjoy choral music not of a religious theme.   
                  </p>
                  <p>Massey also wanted to construct the building in memory of his son Charles, who loved music.[1] Massey also did not want the music hall to make large profits. He wanted both rich and poor to attend events.
                  </p>
                  <p>The building was designed with a neoclassical facade, and features moorish arches that span the width of the interior hall. This interior was inspired by the Alhambra Palace in Spain as well as Louis Sullivan's Chicago Auditorium.
